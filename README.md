:runner::floppy_disk: A small library written in the assembler language. Contains the most necessary functions.

#### Description:
A small set of useful functions can greatly speed up the program, since they are written in a low-level language - Assembler. This project helped me understand how functions work, how they use processor registers, and how they use RAM.

#### Usage:
Before compiling the library, you must install <a href="https://www.nasm.us">nasm</a>. To build a static library, just write the `make` command.

#### Issue:
Unfortunately, the project only works on macOS.
